### Introduction

The [ARP 2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_2600) is a "semi-modular" synthesizer designed by Alan Robert Pearlman - A.R.P. himself - and commercially released in 1971.  It was one of the first synthesizers extensively marketed for education, with a retail price of below $3500.  It is considered a canonical vintage analog synthesizer, so a 'mint' (or fully-restored) ARP 2600 can easily fetch $10K or more today.

The ARP 2600 shows up in a lot of strange places... the synth was integral to the sound of artists from Jean Michel Jarre to Joy Division.  It's also well-known in the sound effects community because of its built-in envelope follower; sound designer Ben Burtt used this to great effect in making the "voice" of R2-D2 in the Star Wars movies.
